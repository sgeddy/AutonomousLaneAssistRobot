# AutonomousLaneAssistRobot
This is a team project from the grad-level course ECE 536, Digital Control Systems at NCSU. The team built an autonomous robot that followed a track with lanes, curves, dashed and solid lines, one line, and could navigate an intersection. An Arduino Uno controller was used in conjunction with an array of infrared sensors. We compared controller designs by writing the controller in Matlab, then converting that to a .ino file. The following controlers were compared: Current Observer, Infinite-Horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator, PID, Prediction Observer, Root Locus, and SISO Lead.
